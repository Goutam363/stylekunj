          At Ewabey, we strive to provide high-quality services and ensure
          customer satisfaction. This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances
          under which refunds may be issued for services provided by Ewabey.
          <ol>

              <strong>Cancellation of Projects</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ewabey does not offer refunds if a user cancels their project.
                  Once a project has been initiated, the user is responsible for
                  fulfilling their contractual obligations and making payments
                  as agreed upon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a user cancels their project, any payments made for
                  completed stages of the project will not be refunded. This
                  includes payments made for completed milestones, deliverables,
                  or other project-related expenses.
                </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unfulfilled Deliverables</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the event that Ewabey is unable to deliver services as
                  specified in the project details, the user may be eligible for
                  a refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To request a refund for unfulfilled deliverables, the user
                  must submit a written claim outlining the specific reasons for
                  the request and providing any relevant documentation or
                  evidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ewabey will review the claim and determine whether the user is
                  eligible for a refund based on the circumstances of the case.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refund Process</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Refund requests must be submitted to Ewabey's customer support
                  team at ewabey99@gmail.com. The request will be reviewed and
                  processed within a reasonable timeframe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a refund is approved, the user will receive the refund
                  amount via the original payment method used for the
                  transaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Refunds will be issued in the currency of the original
